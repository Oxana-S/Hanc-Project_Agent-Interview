industry_faq:
- question: Are you available for emergency repairs today?
  answer_template: We strive to handle emergencies as quickly as possible. Let me
    check real-time technician availability and schedule your priority service call.
    May I have your zip code and a brief description of the issue?
- question: What is your service call fee or diagnostic charge?
  answer_template: Our standard service call/diagnostic fee is [X] dollars. This fee
    is waived if you proceed with the recommended repair with us. Would you like me
    to schedule a diagnostic appointment?
- question: Do you offer warranties on your repairs?
  answer_template: Yes, we stand behind our work. Most repairs come with a [90-day/1-year]
    parts and labor warranty. Specific warranty details are provided with your written
    estimate.
- question: Do you use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts?
  answer_template: We typically use OEM or OEM-equivalent parts to ensure quality
    and compatibility. We will always discuss part options and pricing with you before
    any repair begins.
- question: How long will the repair take?
  answer_template: Repair time varies by job complexity. After our technician diagnoses
    the issue, they will provide a time estimate. For common issues like [example],
    it often takes about [X] hours.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a potential lead asks "How much does it cost to fix a [device]?"
  script: That's a great question. Repair costs can vary based on the specific problem
    and the parts needed. To give you an accurate estimate, our technician first needs
    to diagnose the issue. Our service call fee is [X] dollars, which covers the diagnosis,
    and that amount is applied toward the repair if you choose to proceed with us.
    Would you like to schedule a convenient time for a technician to come out and
    provide a firm quote?
  goal: Convert a price inquiry into a scheduled service call/diagnostic appointment.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions a big box store or national chain competitor.
  script: I understand they're an option. Many of our customers come to us after experiences
    with larger chains because we offer more personalized, expert service. Our technicians
    are often specialized and we provide direct communication with the person doing
    the work. Plus, we're locally owned and invested in our community's satisfaction.
    Can I tell you more about our specific expertise with [their device]?
  goal: Differentiate on quality, expertise, and local service versus impersonal,
    corporate competitors.
- trigger: hesitation_scheduling
  situation: When a prospect is hesitant to book an appointment due to uncertainty.
  script: I totally understand wanting to be sure. Scheduling a diagnostic appointment
    doesn't obligate you to anything. It simply gives you the information and a firm
    price you need to make a confident decision. We're transparent with our pricing
    and will explain everything before any work begins. How about we find a 2-hour
    window that works for you, so you can get the answers you need?
  goal: Overcome hesitation by reducing perceived commitment and emphasizing transparency.

typical_objections:
- objection: I think I can fix it myself or find someone cheaper on Craigslist.
  response: That's understandable to look for value. The risk with DIY or unverified
    help is that a small mistake can lead to a much more expensive problem or even
    a safety hazard. Our technicians are licensed/insured, and our work is guaranteed,
    which protects your home and your wallet in the long run.
- objection: I need to think about it / talk to my spouse.
  response: Absolutely, it's a good decision to discuss. To help with that conversation,
    would it be okay if I emailed you a summary of the recommended repair, the warranty
    details, and our quote? That way, you have all the information in front of you.
    When would be a good time for me to follow up?
- objection: Your service call fee seems high just to look at it.
  response: I hear you. That fee isn't just for 'looking'—it's for the expertise and
    time of a trained technician to properly diagnose the root cause, which is the
    first critical step to a lasting repair. Without a correct diagnosis, any repair
    is just a guess. This fee is fully applied to the repair cost if you choose us,
    making it a no-risk investment in getting the right solution.
