industry_faq:
- question: How do you ensure your system stays compliant with our state's cannabis
    laws?
  answer_template: Our platform is built with compliance as a core feature. We provide
    regular automated updates aligned with state regulatory bulletins and integrate
    directly with official track-and-trace systems like METRC to ensure all data handling
    meets current requirements.
- question: Can your AI agent handle sensitive medical patient information?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Our system is designed with HIPAA and CCPA compliance
    in mind. All voice interactions are encrypted, and we do not store protected health
    information without explicit consent and proper safeguards, which we can configure
    to your specific protocols.
- question: What's the typical cost for implementing an AI voice agent in our dispensary?
  answer_template: Implementation starts at a predictable monthly subscription, often
    less than the cost of one part-time employee. The exact investment depends on
    the call volume and features needed, but we focus on delivering a clear ROI through
    labor savings and increased sales conversion.
- question: How does this work with our existing POS and inventory software?
  answer_template: Our agents integrate with leading cannabis platforms like Flowhub,
    Green Bits, and Cova. We can pull product availability, update order statuses,
    and even help customers find specific items, creating a seamless experience between
    the phone and your in-store systems.
- question: We're a cultivation facility, not a store. How can this help us?
  answer_template: For cultivators, our agents can automate B2B order inquiries, schedule
    wholesale pickups, provide harvest batch updates to distributors, and manage compliance
    documentation requests, freeing your team to focus on production.
- question: What if a customer asks a question the AI can't answer?
  answer_template: Our system is designed to gracefully escalate complex or sensitive
    issues to a live human agent at your business, ensuring the customer always gets
    the help they need while the AI handles the routine majority of calls.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: compliance_concern
  situation: When a prospect expresses anxiety about changing regulations or past
    compliance fines.
  script: I understand completely. Regulatory whiplash is one of the biggest hidden
    costs in this industry. Our AI agent acts as your first line of defense, providing
    your team with voice-activated compliance checklists and the latest rule changes
    for your state. It helps prevent costly mistakes before they happen. Can I show
    you how it works for a specific regulation you're dealing with?
  goal: Reframe the AI from a cost to a risk-mitigation and insurance tool, and schedule
    a demo.
- trigger: staffing_pain
  situation: When the prospect mentions high turnover, training costs, or being short-staffed.
  script: It sounds like your team is stretched thin, especially with the constant
    training needed. Our solution directly addresses that by handling the repetitive
    questions about store hours, location, basic product info, and appointment booking
    24/7. This lets your skilled budtenders focus on high-value consultations and
    sales. Think of it as giving every employee a knowledgeable assistant that never
    calls in sick.
  goal: Position the AI as a workforce multiplier that improves job satisfaction and
    sales, leading to a discussion about call volume.
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When the prospect immediately asks about cost.
  script: That's a great question. We price based on the call volume and features
    you need, typically starting at [entry_point] per month. To put that in perspective,
    most of our clients see a full return on investment in under 6 months by reducing
    missed calls, increasing after-hours order conversions, and saving on labor for
    routine tasks. Would it be helpful to calculate a specific ROI based on your current
    call metrics?
  goal: Move past sticker shock by focusing on value and ROI, and transition to a
    discovery conversation.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When the prospect names another CRM or generic call center service.
  script: Many of those are great tools, but they aren't built for the unique challenges
    of cannabis—like compliance-integrated conversations or understanding terms like
    'indica vs. sativa' or 'live resin.' We specialize solely in this vertical. Our
    AI is trained on cannabis-specific FAQs, integrates with your METRC and POS systems,
    and is designed to be compliant from the ground up. It's not a generic tool you
    have to adapt; it's a specialist for your industry.
  goal: Differentiate on vertical specialization and native compliance, not just features.

typical_objections:
- objection: Our customers prefer to talk to a real person.
  response: We absolutely agree that the human connection is vital, especially for
    complex consultations. Our AI handles the repetitive, time-consuming questions—like
    'are you open?' or 'do you have this edibles brand?'—so your *real people* have
    more time for the meaningful, high-value conversations that truly build relationships
    and sales.
- objection: We're too small / our call volume isn't high enough.
  response: Even a handful of missed calls a day represents lost revenue. Our entry-level
    plans are designed for smaller operations. Furthermore, the AI ensures every caller
    gets an immediate, professional response, which builds trust from the first contact,
    setting you apart from competitors that send calls to voicemail.
- objection: We tried an automated phone system before and it frustrated our customers.
  response: Traditional IVR systems with confusing menus are indeed frustrating. Our
    AI uses natural conversation—customers just ask their question in their own words.
    It's a dramatically better experience that actually resolves their issue faster
    in most cases, as they don't have to wait on hold.
- objection: Implementation sounds complicated and we're too busy.
  response: That's a valid concern. Our implementation is turnkey. We handle the setup,
    integration with your key systems, and training. The goal is to make you *less*
    busy by taking a predictable, tedious task off your plate. We can have a basic
    version live for you in a matter of days.
