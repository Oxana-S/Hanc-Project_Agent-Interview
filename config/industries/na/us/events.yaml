    you our package PDF, or would you prefer to discuss what's most important for
    your event with a planner?
- question: What is your availability for [Month]?
  answer_template: Let me check our live calendar for [Month]. I see we have [Number]
    Saturdays available and [Number] Fridays. To hold a specific date, we typically
    require a deposit. Shall I connect you with someone to discuss details?

  answer_template: For food and beverage, we work with a select list of approved caterers
    to ensure quality and compliance. For other vendors like florists or photographers,
    you are generally welcome to use your own, subject to a certificate of insurance.

    prior to the event for a partial deposit refund. The specific terms are outlined

sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a caller leads with "How much does it cost to book your venue?"
  script: I'd be happy to discuss pricing, which can vary based on your guest count,
    date, and specific services. To give you the most accurate estimate, could you
    tell me your target date and approximate number of guests? This way, I can check
    availability and provide a tailored quote or connect you with a planner who can
    detail our package options.
  goal: Qualify the lead and move the conversation beyond a generic price, setting
    the stage for a detailed consultation.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a caller says, "I'm also looking at [Competitor Venue]."
  script: That's a great venue as well. Many clients choose us because of our [Key
    Differentiation, e.g., dedicated on-site coordinator, more flexible vendor policy,
    superior in-house AV]. What are the top two or three things most important to
    you for your event? I can highlight how we specifically excel in those areas.
  goal: Acknowledge the competition politely, pivot to our unique value proposition,
    and deepen understanding of the client's priorities.
- trigger: hesitation_time
  situation: When a caller seems interested but hesitant, saying "I need to think
    about it" or "I'll get back to you."
  script: I completely understand wanting to consider your options. To help your decision,
    would it be useful if I emailed you a detailed comparison of our packages and
    availability for your date? Also, would you be open to a quick, no-obligation
    virtual tour later this week to get a better feel for the space?
  goal: Overcome stall tactics by providing immediate, tangible next steps (information,

typical_objections:

    your event runs smoothly and your time is freed up. Many clients find our automation

    a pilot program focused on one pain point, like lead qualification, to demonstrate
    the value?
- objection: We don't need this; our staff handles calls just fine.
  response: That's great you have a dedicated team. Our goal isn't to replace them,
    but to empower them. By letting our AI handle the repetitive after-hours and initial
    screening calls, your staff can focus on high-value tasks like closing deals and
    creative planning. This often leads to higher job satisfaction and revenue.

    who are already pre-qualified and interested.
