industry_faq:
- question: What are your hours, and do you handle emergencies?
  answer_template: Our regular clinic hours are [CLINIC_HOURS]. For after-hours emergencies, our AI assistant can immediately connect you with our on-call vet or help schedule you at our partner emergency
    clinic to ensure your pet gets timely care.
- question: How much is a routine check-up or vaccination?
  answer_template: The cost for a wellness exam typically starts at $[EXAM_PRICE], and vaccines vary based on your pet's needs. Our AI assistant can provide a more detailed estimate based on your pet's
    age and vaccine history, and even schedule an appointment for you.
- question: My pet needs a prescription refill. How do I get that?
  answer_template: We can help with that! Our AI assistant can submit a refill request to our veterinarians for approval. Please have your pet's name and the medication details ready. You can also request
    delivery or pick-up through our online pharmacy.
- question: Do you offer payment plans or accept pet insurance?
  answer_template: We accept all major pet insurance plans and can provide the necessary documentation for your claim. We also offer third-party financing options like CareCredit. Our AI assistant can explain
    these options in detail and even help you start an application.
- question: How do I get my pet's records transferred to you?
  answer_template: Welcome! We'll need your previous vet's contact information. Our AI assistant can help you authorize the record transfer digitally, saving you a phone call. We'll reach out to them directly
    to get your pet's full history.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a clinic owner or manager asks about the cost of the AI voice agent service.
  script: I understand budget is key. Our system is designed to pay for itself by filling canceled appointments and capturing after-hours calls that often become billable visits. Entry-level plans start
    at around $[ENTRY_PRICE]/month, but we tailor pricing based on your call volume. Would you be open to a quick analysis of your missed call and no-show data to see what your potential savings could be?
  goal: Move the conversation from price to value and ROI, and schedule a deeper discovery call.
- trigger: busy_season
  situation: When speaking to a clinic ahead of a known busy period (e.g., spring, before holidays).
  script: With [UPCOMING_SEASON] around the corner, I know your team gets overwhelmed with booking requests and reminders. Our AI agent can handle that surge, ensuring no new client call is missed and every
    scheduled appointment is confirmed. We can have it live before the rush starts, acting as a scalable front desk assistant to keep revenue high and team stress low. Can we plan a setup timeline?
  goal: Create urgency tied to a seasonal pain point and secure a commitment to implement.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When the prospect mentions a competing service (e.g., another answering service or software).
  script: That's a good option for basic answering. Where we differ is proactive revenue generation. We don't just take messages; we schedule appointments directly into your PIMS, process payments, and
    run reactivation campaigns to bring back lapsed clients. Think of us as an AI-powered business development manager, not just a switchboard. Would you be interested in a side-by-side comparison of features?
  goal: Differentiate on advanced functionality and business impact, not just cost.
- trigger: compliance_concern
  situation: When the prospect raises concerns about HIPAA or data security.
  script: That's our top priority. Our system is fully HIPAA-compliant and CCPA-ready. We use enterprise-grade encryption, never store sensitive payment data, and all call logs are secured. We can sign
    a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and provide a full security audit report. Your clients' data is as safe with us as it is in your own practice management system.
  goal: Alleviate security concerns with specific compliance measures and build trust.

typical_objections:
- objection: Our clients prefer talking to a real person.
  response: They do, and they still will for complex medical discussions. Our AI handles the repetitive tasks (scheduling, reminders, refills) so your real people have more quality time for those valuable
    conversations. It also ensures a real person never misses a call because they're busy with another client.
- objection: We're a small practice; this seems like overkill.
  response: Small practices benefit the most. You have fewer staff to cover calls, and every missed appointment hits your bottom line harder. Our AI acts as your always-available front desk, helping you
    compete with larger clinics on service while keeping your costs lean and personal touch intact.
- objection: I'm worried about the setup and training being complicated.
  response: We handle the entire setup, including integration with your existing software. There's no training for your staff—the AI works out of the box. We provide a dedicated onboarding specialist, and
    you'll typically see value within the first two weeks.
- objection: We already use [Online Booking Software]. Why do we need this?
  response: That's great for clients who go online. Our AI captures the 70%+ of clients who still pick up the phone first. It converts those immediate, high-intent calls into booked appointments directly
    in your system, working alongside your online tool to capture 100% of appointment requests.
