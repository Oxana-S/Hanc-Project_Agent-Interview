industry_faq:
- question: What types of care do you provide?
  answer_template: We specialize in [Service Type, e.g., in-home personal care and
    companionship] for seniors, helping them live safely and independently. Can you
    tell me a bit more about the specific needs you're looking to address?
- question: Are your services covered by Medicare or insurance?
  answer_template: Coverage varies greatly. Medicare typically covers skilled nursing
    or therapy under specific conditions, but not long-term custodial care. Many long-term
    care insurance policies, VA benefits, or Medicaid may help with costs. I can connect
    you with our benefits specialist for a detailed review of your situation.
- question: How do you screen and train your caregivers?
  answer_template: All our caregivers undergo thorough background checks, reference
    verification, and specialized training in areas like dementia care, first aid,
    and CPR. We ensure they are not only qualified but also compassionate and reliable.
- question: What are your hours of operation?
  answer_template: We provide care services 24/7. Our administrative office is open
    from 8 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday. However, our AI assistant, which you're
    speaking with now, is available anytime to answer questions, schedule calls, or
    direct you to emergency support.
- question: Can we get started right away?
  answer_template: We typically begin with a free, no-obligation assessment to understand
    your loved one's needs and create a personalized care plan. I can schedule that
    for you with one of our care coordinators. How does [Propose a time] sound?
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a caller immediately asks "How much does this cost?"
  script: That's an important question. The cost really depends on the level and schedule
    of care needed. For example, a few hours of companion care per week starts at
    a different point than 24/7 skilled nursing. To give you an accurate estimate,
    I'd need to understand the specific situation. Could you share what kind of support
    you're looking for?
  goal: Deflect a premature price objection and gather qualifying information about
    needs and budget.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a caller mentions a specific competitor like "I'm also looking at
    Home Instead."
  script: That's a great company to consider. Many families evaluate several options.
    Where we often stand out is our focus on [Our Differentiation, e.g., seamless
    technology integration that keeps families constantly updated and reduces administrative
    stress for our caregivers]. This allows our staff to focus more on quality care.
    Would you be interested in hearing how that works in practice?
  goal: Acknowledge the competitor, pivot to a key differentiator without disparaging,
    and re-engage the caller.
- trigger: need_urgency_low
  situation: When a caller says "We're just starting to look" or "It's not urgent."
  script: I completely understand. It's smart to plan ahead. Many families find that
    having information early reduces stress later. Can I send you our free guide on
    'Questions to Ask When Choosing an Elder Care Provider'? I can also schedule a
    brief, pressure-free chat with a consultant for when you're ready, even if that's
    a few weeks from now.
  goal: Nurture the lead, provide value without pressure, and secure a future point
    of contact.
- trigger: compliance_question
  situation: When a caller asks "How do you handle privacy and health information?"
  script: Excellent question. We take compliance very seriously. Our entire system,
    including this voice assistant, is built to be fully compliant with HIPAA for
    health data and CCPA for consumer privacy. All data is encrypted and access is
    strictly controlled. Your family's information is safe with us.
  goal: Build immediate trust by demonstrating expertise in critical regulatory requirements.

typical_objections:
- objection: This sounds too impersonal for caring for my loved one.
  response: I understand that concern completely. Our goal isn't to replace the human
    touch but to support it. By handling the routine calls and reminders, our technology
    actually gives your caregiver more focused, uninterrupted time with your loved
    one. It enhances personal care, doesn't replace it.
- objection: We're not very tech-savvy. This seems complicated.
  response: That's a common thought, but we've designed it specifically for ease of
    use. There's no app to download. Your family interacts with a simple, natural
    phone call. We handle all the complexity on our end. We can even do a test call
    to show you how straightforward it is.
- objection: We already have a system that works okay. I don't see the need to change.
  response: If it's working, that's great. Many of our clients came to us thinking
    the same thing, but found that 'okay' was masking hidden costs in staff time,
    missed communications, or family stress. Could we explore a single pain point,
    like after-hours calls or reminder management, to see if there's a small win for
    you?
- objection: Your service is an added monthly cost on top of everything else.
  response: It's an investment that typically pays for itself within the first month
    by reducing administrative labor, improving client retention, and preventing costly
    errors like missed appointments. Let me walk you through a quick example based
    on your current call volume...
