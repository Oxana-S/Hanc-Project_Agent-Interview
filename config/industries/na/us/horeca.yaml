    scenario: Automating 50% of reservation calls and reducing no-shows by 10% for
      a mid-sized restaurant.

  - 799
  value_anchors:
  - Save 20+ staff hours per week on phone duty.
  - Reduce no-show rates by up to 50%.
  - Never miss a reservation or order call again.
recommended_functions:
- name: table_reservation
  priority: high
  reason: Core function for restaurants; captures bookings directly 24/7.
- name: order_taking
  priority: high
  reason: Critical for takeout, delivery, and room service revenue streams.
- name: confirmation_reminders
  priority: high
  reason: Drastically reduces costly no-shows for tables and events.
- name: faq_handler
  priority: medium
  reason: Instantly answers common questions about hours, menu, parking, saving staff
    time.
- name: outbound_marketing

  reason: Proactively fills tables during slow periods by calling loyalty members
    with offers.
sales_scripts:
- goal: Overcome initial sticker shock by focusing on immediate ROI.
  script: I understand. At $299/month, it might seem like an added cost. Let's break
    it down. If our agent just saves your host 10 hours a week from answering phones,
    that's $400 in labor savings monthly. Plus, if we reduce your no-shows by just
    two tables a week, that's another $800 in recovered revenue. You're looking at
    a $1200 net gain in the first month. Does that make the investment feel more tangible?
  situation: When the prospect says "It's too expensive."
  trigger: price_objection
- goal: Position the agent as a premium, always-available extension of their brand.
  script: Great question. Unlike a basic answering service, our AI agent is trained
    on your specific menu, hours, and policies. It doesn't just take a message—it
    can book a table for Saturday at 8 PM for four, confirm a gluten-free preference,
    and send a reminder, all without human intervention. It provides a seamless, high-quality
    experience that reflects well on your establishment, even when you're busy or
    closed.
  situation: When asked how this differs from a traditional answering service.
  trigger: vs_answering_service
- goal: Secure a trial by addressing data privacy concerns upfront (CCPA).
  script: We take data privacy very seriously. Our system is designed to be CCPA compliant.
    Customer data from calls is handled securely, and we can integrate with your existing
    systems without storing sensitive information long-term. We can start with a limited
    pilot, just handling after-hours calls, so you can see the value with minimal
    risk. Would a two-week trial during your slower lunch hours work to start?
  situation: When the prospect is hesitant about data security or wants to test.

typical_objections:
- objection: We don't get enough phone calls to justify it.
  response: Even a few missed calls a day are lost customers. Our agent also helps
    convert more of the calls you do get by being available instantly, 24/7, and can
    up-sell larger tables or event bookings. It's about maximizing every opportunity.
- objection: My staff enjoys talking to customers on the phone.
  response: That's wonderful for personal touch. Our agent handles the repetitive,
    transactional calls—'what are your hours?', 'do you have a table for two at 7?'.
    This frees your staff to have those more meaningful, in-person interactions that
    truly build loyalty.
- objection: What if it messes up an order?
  response: The agent is trained on your specific menu and protocols. For complex
    situations, it can seamlessly transfer the call to a live person. It's designed
    to handle the routine perfectly, so your team only steps in for the exceptions.
