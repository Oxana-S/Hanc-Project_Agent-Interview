- question: Is your system compliant with US data privacy laws like CCPA?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Our platform is built with CCPA and HIPAA compliance
    in mind. We include features for automated consent management, data access reporting,
    and secure handling of all player interactions.
- question: Can you handle player support during a major game launch or patch?

    interactions, handling common launch-day issues like download problems, login
    errors, and basic gameplay questions, freeing your human team for complex cases.

sales_scripts:
- trigger: support_capacity_question
  situation: When a prospect mentions being overwhelmed by player support tickets.
  script: I understand how a flood of support tickets can cripple your team's ability
    to focus on game development. Our AI voice agent can instantly resolve 60-70%
    of common tier-1 issues like password resets, purchase verification, and basic
    troubleshooting. This would free your team to work on the complex, rewarding problems
    that truly need a human touch. Can I show you how our automation handles a typical
    billing question?
  goal: Demonstrate immediate value by solving a critical capacity problem and repositioning
    their team's role.
- trigger: compliance_concern
  situation: When a prospect expresses worry about CCPA or data security.
  script: That's a very valid concern, especially with the strict regulations here.
    Our platform is designed as a compliance ally. Every player interaction is logged
    for audit trails, and we manage consent recording and data access requests automatically
    via voice. Implementing our system actually strengthens your compliance posture.
    Would you like to see our compliance feature dashboard?
  goal: Turn a perceived risk into a strength and build trust around regulatory adherence.
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about cost early in the conversation.

    clients often see an ROI within 3-6 months through reduced support costs and increased
    player spending. For example, one studio saved $8,000 monthly on support while
    boosting DLC sales by 15%. What's the main challenge you're hoping to solve with
    a solution like this?

typical_objections:
- objection: Our players prefer text chat, not phone calls.
  response: That's a great point. We find voice is perfect for high-value, high-touch
    interactions where personalization matters most—like re-engaging a top spender
    or resolving a frustrating account issue. It's a powerful supplement to text,
    not a replacement. We can start with outbound campaigns only to test player response.
- objection: This sounds too expensive for our studio right now.
  response: I appreciate you being upfront about budget. Consider the cost of player
    churn or a failed launch due to poor support. We can begin with a single, high-impact
    function like retention calls or compliance management. At $2,500/month, the ROI
    from retaining just a few dozen players often covers the cost. Let's identify
    one priority area where automation would pay for itself fastest.
- objection: We're worried about the AI sounding robotic and hurting our brand.
  response: That's crucial. Our voice agents use advanced conversational AI trained
    on gaming terminology and can be tailored to match your game's tone—whether it's
    epic fantasy or casual fun. We provide extensive voice customization and continuous
    training to ensure interactions feel natural and enhance your brand experience.
