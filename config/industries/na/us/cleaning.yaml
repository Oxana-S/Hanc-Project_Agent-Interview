industry_faq:
- question: How much do you charge for a standard house cleaning?
  answer_template: Our pricing is customized based on your home's size, condition,
    and the specific services requested. For a quick quote, I can ask you a few questions
    about square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and desired frequency. Most
    customers in your area invest between $X and $Y for a standard cleaning.
- question: Are your cleaners bonded and insured?
  answer_template: Yes, absolutely. All of our cleaning professionals are fully insured
    and bonded for your peace of mind. We also conduct background checks. Would you
    like me to email you a copy of our certificate of insurance?
- question: What is your cancellation policy?
  answer_template: We request at least 24 hours notice for cancellations to allow
    us to adjust our team's schedule. For recurring services, we offer a convenient
    online portal to manage or reschedule your appointments.
- question: Do I need to be home during the cleaning?
  answer_template: That's entirely up to your preference. Many of our clients provide
    us with access via a lockbox, garage code, or smart lock. We have secure key management
    protocols in place.
- question: What cleaning products do you use?
  answer_template: We use professional-grade, effective cleaning solutions. We can
    also use your preferred products if you have specific requests. For clients with
    sensitivities, we offer eco-friendly/green cleaning options.
- question: How do I pay for the service?
  answer_template: We accept all major credit cards and ACH bank transfers. For recurring
    services, we offer convenient auto-pay. A secure payment link is emailed or texted
    to you after each service.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks for pricing upfront without providing details.
  script: I understand wanting to know the investment. To give you an accurate quote,
    I need to ask a couple quick questions so we don't waste your time with a number
    that doesn't fit your home. Is your property a house, condo, or apartment? And
    roughly how many bedrooms and bathrooms?
  goal: Engage the prospect in a conversation to qualify them and gather essential
    information for an accurate quote.
- trigger: service_details
  situation: When a prospect is asking about what's included in a specific service.
  script: Great question. Our standard cleaning focuses on high-traffic areas and
    includes vacuuming, mopping, dusting, kitchen and bathroom sanitization, and making
    surfaces shine. For a deep clean, we tackle areas often missed, like inside appliances,
    baseboards, and light fixtures. Based on your needs, which service sounds like
    a better fit to start?
  goal: Educate the prospect on service tiers and guide them towards making a choice.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions they are considering or currently use another
    cleaning service.
  script: That's helpful context. Many of our clients switched to us for our reliable
    scheduling, our thorough background-checked teams, and our consistent quality.
    What's the most important factor for you in a cleaning service - is it reliability,
    thoroughness, or perhaps flexible scheduling?
  goal: Differentiate our service and uncover the prospect's primary pain point or
    need.
- trigger: booking_hesitation
  situation: When a prospect is interested but hesitant to book the first appointment.
  script: It makes sense to want to ensure it's the right fit. We offer a 100% satisfaction
    guarantee on your first clean. If you're not happy with any area, we'll come back
    and reclean it at no charge. Would you like to secure a date for your first clean
    under that guarantee?
  goal: Overcome hesitation by reducing perceived risk and prompting a commitment.

typical_objections:
- objection: I already have a cleaner I'm happy with.
  response: That's great to hear! Many of our clients were in the same position but
    valued having a reliable company as a backup for when their regular cleaner is
    unavailable or if they need an extra deep clean. We also offer a satisfaction
    guarantee. Would it be worth having us as a backup option?
- objection: It's too expensive.
  response: I understand considering the investment. Our pricing reflects our fully
    insured staff, quality-controlled work, and the convenience of reliable scheduling
    we provide. Think of it as buying back your free time and peace of mind. Could
    we start with a one-time deep clean so you can experience the value firsthand?
- objection: I'm worried about letting strangers into my home.
  response: Your concern is completely valid. We mitigate that risk by conducting
    thorough background checks on all team members, they always work in uniformed
    pairs, and we are fully bonded and insured. We also offer lockbox or smart lock
    options if you prefer not to be home.
