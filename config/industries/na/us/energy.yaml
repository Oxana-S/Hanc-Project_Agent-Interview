industry_faq:
- question: How do you ensure my customer data is secure and CCPA compliant?
  answer_template: Our AI voice agent platform uses enterprise-grade encryption and access controls. All scripts are designed with mandatory privacy disclosures, and we do not store sensitive data beyond
    the transaction. We can provide a compliance audit trail.
- question: Can this system handle high call volumes during a major power outage?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Our cloud-based platform scales automatically to manage thousands of concurrent calls, providing outage updates, collecting location reports, and prioritizing emergency cases
    without overloading your staff.
- question: How does this integrate with our existing utility billing system?
  answer_template: We offer pre-built connectors for major CIS platforms like Oracle Utilities and SAP. Our team handles the API integration to enable seamless balance checks, payment processing, and bill
    explanations.
- question: What's the typical setup time and disruption to our current operations?
  answer_template: A standard deployment takes 4-6 weeks with minimal disruption. We phase the rollout, starting with non-critical functions like payment reminders, and provide full training for your team.
- question: Can the AI agent explain complex rate plans or time-of-use pricing to customers?
  answer_template: Yes. The agent is trained on your specific rate tariffs and can explain them in simple terms, compare plans based on past usage, and even calculate potential savings for the customer.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about the cost of implementation.
  script: I understand budgeting is key. Our solutions typically start around $2,500 per month for core automation, scaling based on call volume and integrations. The ROI often comes from reducing manual
    handling costs by 30-50%. Would you like to see a customized ROI estimate based on your current call center metrics?
  goal: Move past sticker shock by focusing on ROI and offering a personalized analysis.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When the prospect mentions a competitor like 'Tesla Energy' or 'Siemens'.
  script: Those are great companies in the energy space. Our differentiation is specializing in AI-driven voice communication tailored for utility operations—like outage management and compliance-heavy
    customer service. We're not just a generic CRM; we're built for the specific workflows of power and gas companies. Can I show you a demo of our outage response module?
  goal: Reframe the comparison to highlight our niche expertise and offer a concrete demonstration.
- trigger: objection_complexity
  situation: When the prospect worries the system is too complex for their team.
  script: That's a common concern. We handle the technical complexity on our end. Your team interacts with a simple dashboard for monitoring and reporting. We also provide dedicated support and training.
    Many of our clients find their staff prefers focusing on complex issues instead of repetitive calls. Would a brief dashboard walk-through ease your mind?
  goal: Alleviate fear of complexity by emphasizing ease of use and support.
- trigger: probe_pain
  situation: Initial discovery call to identify key issues.
  script: 'Many utilities we work with struggle with high call center costs during peak events or challenges retaining customers in competitive markets. Which area is creating more pressure for your team
    right now: operational efficiency or customer growth and retention?'
  goal: Identify the primary pain point to tailor the conversation.
