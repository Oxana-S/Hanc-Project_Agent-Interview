industry_faq:
- question: Do you have experience working with manufacturers in Ontario/Alberta/etc.?
  answer_template: Absolutely. We have successfully implemented solutions for manufacturers
    across Canada, including in [Province]. We understand the local regulatory and
    supply chain landscape.
- question: How do you ensure our data is secure and compliant with PIPEDA?
  answer_template: Our platform is hosted on Canadian servers with stringent security
    protocols. We ensure all data handling processes are designed for PIPEDA compliance,
    and we can provide a data processing agreement.
- question: Can your system integrate with our existing ERP software?
  answer_template: Yes, our AI agent platform offers robust APIs and pre-built connectors
    for major ERP systems like [Mention their ERP if known, or Sage/NetSuite]. Our
    team handles the integration.
- question: What is the typical implementation time?
  answer_template: For standard deployments, you can expect to be live within 2-4
    weeks. The timeline depends on the complexity of integrations and call flow design.
- question: How do you measure ROI for a manufacturer?
  answer_template: We track key metrics like call deflection rate, lead conversion
    lift, and administrative hours saved. Most clients see a full return on investment
    within 4-6 months through reduced labor costs and increased sales.
- question: Can the agent handle technical questions about our products?
  answer_template: The agent can be trained on your specific product catalog and FAQs
    to handle common technical queries. For highly complex issues, it will seamlessly
    transfer the call to your engineering team.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about cost early in the conversation.
  script: That's a great question. Our pricing is based on the call volume and specific
    features you need, typically starting at an entry point of around $300 CAD per
    month. To give you a precise quote, could you share approximately how many customer
    or supplier calls you handle daily that could be automated?
  goal: Qualify the lead's size and needs while providing a general price anchor.
- trigger: time_constraint
  situation: When a prospect says they are too busy to implement new technology.
  script: I completely understand how busy manufacturing operations are. That's exactly
    why our service is designed for a quick setup with minimal disruption. We handle
    the technical heavy lifting, and the time your team saves from answering routine
    calls will quickly offset the initial time investment. Can we schedule a brief
    15-minute demo to show you how it works?
  goal: Reframe the objection into a benefit and secure a next step.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions a competitor's name.
  script: Yes, we're familiar with them. A key difference is our specialized focus
    on the Canadian manufacturing sector. We build in understanding of local supply
    chains, compliance like PIPEDA, and integrate with ERPs like Sage and NetSuite
    that are common here. Our goal is to be a true partner, not just a vendor.
  goal: Differentiate based on local expertise and relevant integrations.
- trigger: need_approval
  situation: When the prospect needs to discuss with a partner or finance.
  script: Of course, it's smart to involve your team. To help with that conversation,
    I can send you a one-page summary highlighting the typical ROI we see for manufacturers
    of your size, focusing on labor cost savings and improved customer response times.
    What's the best email to send that to?
  goal: Collect contact info and provide tangible value to advance the internal sale.

typical_objections:
- objection: Our team is small and handles calls personally. We don't want to sound
    like a robot to our clients.
  response: That's a valid concern. Our AI agent is designed to sound natural and
    handle only the routine, repetitive questions (like 'is my order ready?' or 'what's
    your address?'). This actually frees up your team to have more meaningful, high-value
    conversations with clients, strengthening those personal relationships.
- objection: We've had bad experiences with technology integrations being complicated
    and expensive.
  response: We hear that often. That's why we offer a managed onboarding process with
    clear timelines. For common systems like QuickBooks or Sage, we have streamlined
    connectors. We can start with a simple call-forwarding setup to prove value before
    any deep integration.
- objection: It's not in the budget this quarter.
  response: Understood. Budget cycles are tight. Many of our clients start with a
    specific, low-cost pilot project, like automating after-hours intake for service
    requests. This shows concrete savings that can help justify a larger rollout in
    the next budget. Would exploring a pilot be feasible?
