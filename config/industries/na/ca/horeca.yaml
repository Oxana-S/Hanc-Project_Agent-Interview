sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about cost early in the conversation.
  script: Our service starts at $150 CAD per month, which is typically less than the
    cost of one part-time hostess shift per week. We focus on delivering a clear ROI
    by reducing no-shows and capturing more direct orders. Can I share a quick example
    based on your current call volume?
  goal: Reframe cost as an investment with quick payback, and move to a needs analysis.
- trigger: competitor_mentioned
  situation: When the prospect mentions using a platform like OpenTable.
  script: That's a great platform for online bookings. Our AI agent complements that
    by handling all the phone calls they don't cover—like confirmations, menu questions,
    and taking direct delivery orders. This helps you reduce commissions and build
    a direct relationship with your customers. Would you be interested in seeing how
    they work together?
  goal: Position as a complementary tool that enhances their existing stack and improves
    profitability.
- trigger: skepticism_automation
  situation: When the prospect worries automation will feel impersonal.
  script: I understand that concern. Our AI is trained specifically for hospitality—it's
    warm, professional, and handles routine tasks so your staff can provide that personal
    touch to guests in the dining room. It actually enhances the customer experience
    by reducing hold times. We can customize its tone to match your brand perfectly.
  goal: Overcome fear of losing personal touch by positioning AI as handling routine
    work to free up staff.
- trigger: busy_season
  situation: When talking to a prospect during their high season (e.g., December,
    summer).
  script: This is exactly when an AI agent delivers the most value. It manages the
    surge in reservation calls and no-shows, ensuring you don't miss a single booking
    during your busiest and most profitable time of year. We can have it live in a
    matter of days to help you through this peak.
  goal: Create urgency by tying the solution directly to their current high-stress,
    high-revenue period.

typical_objections:
- objection: We don't have enough call volume to justify it.
  response: Even a few missed calls per day can mean lost revenue. Our system also
    proactively reduces no-shows and can promote your specials, adding value beyond
    just answering calls.
- objection: I'm worried it will sound robotic and hurt our brand.
  response: We specialize in natural, brand-aligned voices. We can customize the script
    and tone to be as warm and professional as your best host. It handles the routine
    questions so your team can focus on genuine hospitality.
- objection: We already use OpenTable for online bookings.
  response: Perfect. Our AI agent handles the phone calls that OpenTable doesn't—confirmations,
    changes, and general inquiries. It integrates with OpenTable to keep everything
    in sync, giving you a complete solution.
- objection: It's too expensive for a small business.
  response: At $150/month, it's often less than 10% of a part-time host's wages. If
    it saves just 3 no-shows a month or captures 5 direct delivery orders, it's already
    paid for itself. Let's calculate a quick ROI based on your numbers.
