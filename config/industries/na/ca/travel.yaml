industry_faq:
- question: What is your cancellation policy?
  answer_template: Our cancellation policy varies by supplier and package. For full
    details specific to your booking, I can connect you with your itinerary details
    or transfer you to a live agent who can review the terms with you.
- question: Do I need a visa for my destination?
  answer_template: Visa requirements depend on your citizenship and destination. I
    can provide general information, but for the most accurate and official requirements,
    I recommend consulting the Government of Canada's travel advisories page or the
    embassy of your destination country.
- question: Is travel insurance included?
  answer_template: Travel insurance is typically an optional add-on for your protection.
    I can provide details on our recommended plans, which cover medical emergencies,
    trip cancellation, and baggage loss, among other things. Would you like me to
    go over the options?
- question: Can you price match an offer I found online?
  answer_template: We strive to offer competitive pricing. If you have a verifiable
    quote for the identical itinerary from another accredited agency, please provide
    the details, and I will initiate a price match request with our team for your
    review.
- question: What happens if my flight is delayed or cancelled?
  answer_template: In case of airline-initiated schedule changes, we will automatically
    work to rebook you on the next available option and notify you. For real-time
    assistance during travel disruptions, our 24/7 support line, which this AI agent
    is a part of, is available to help.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a potential client asks about the cost of implementing an AI voice
    agent.
  script: I understand budget is a key consideration. For a travel agency of your
    size, implementation typically starts around 250-500 CAD per month. This investment
    often pays for itself within 3-6 months by capturing after-hours bookings and
    reducing missed calls. Could I ask about your average call volume to provide a
    more precise estimate?
  goal: Qualify the lead by providing a transparent entry point and positioning the
    solution as having a clear ROI.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When the client mentions they are also looking at a large online travel
    agency (OTA) or another call center solution.
  script: That's a fair comparison. While large OTAs offer scale, our AI voice agent
    is designed specifically to enhance *your* brand's customer service, not replace
    it. We integrate directly with your existing tools like Amadeus or your CRM, keeping
    the client relationship and data with you, all while providing 24/7 support like
    the big players. It's about empowering your agency, not losing your clients to
    a platform.
  goal: Differentiate on brand ownership, integration, and personalized service versus
    impersonal platforms.
- trigger: objection_automation
  situation: When the client worries that an AI agent will feel impersonal or damage
    customer relationships.
  script: 'That''s a crucial point. Our AI agent is designed to handle routine, repetitive
    tasks like booking confirmations, policy FAQs, and simple changes. This actually
    frees up your expert human agents to focus on complex itineraries, high-value
    sales, and building deeper relationships. Think of it as giving your team a powerful
    assistant to handle the administrative load, so they can do what they do best:
    create amazing travel experiences.'
  goal: Reframe the AI as a tool that augments and empowers human staff, improving
    service quality.
