typical_objections:
- objection: This seems expensive for an automated system.
  response: I understand. Consider that it works 24/7 to capture leads and answer
    questions. If it saves just 10 hours of staff time per month or secures one extra
    wholesale account, it pays for itself immediately. We can start with a basic package
    focused on your biggest pain point.
- objection: I prefer my customers to always talk to a real person.
  response: Absolutely, and so do we. The goal isn't to replace your team but to empower
    them. By letting the AI handle repetitive tasks like 'are you open?' or 'do you
    have this in stock?', your staff has more time for meaningful, revenue-generating
    conversations about products and consultations.
- objection: We're too small / our call volume isn't high enough.
  response: Even a few missed calls can mean lost sales. Our system scales with you.
    It ensures every call is answered professionally, captures leads after hours,
    and provides consistent information. This helps you look and operate like a larger,
    more established business, which builds customer trust.
