sales_scripts:
- trigger: compliance_concern
  situation: When a prospect expresses worry about the complexity of cannabis regulations.
  script: I understand. Navigating the Cannabis Act and provincial rules is a full-time
    job in itself. Our AI agent acts as your first line of defense, automating compliance
    check-ins and report generation. It integrates directly with your seed-to-sale
    system like Metrc to flag potential issues before they become problems, giving
    you peace of mind and saving countless administrative hours.
  goal: Position the AI as a compliance risk mitigator and time-saver.
- trigger: inquiry_overflow
  situation: When a business owner mentions staff being overwhelmed by phone calls,
    especially about basic questions.
  script: It's so common for budtenders to get tied up on the phone when they could
    be driving sales on the floor. Our voice agent can handle 100% of those routine
    calls about hours, location, basic product legality, and even schedule pickups.
    This instantly frees your team to provide the expert, in-person service that builds
    customer loyalty and increases basket size.
  goal: Frame the solution as a direct revenue protector and staff optimizer.
- trigger: delivery_logistics
  situation: When a retailer discusses challenges with managing delivery orders and
    age verification.
  script: Managing delivery windows and verifying age 19+ for every order is crucial
    but manual. Our agent automates the entire confirmation process, sends timely
    reminders to customers, and prompts drivers to check ID. This reduces failed deliveries,
    ensures compliance, and improves the customer experience with less work for your
    team.
  goal: Highlight automation of a critical, compliance-heavy process to improve efficiency
    and safety.
- trigger: cost_question
  situation: When the prospect asks about pricing.
  script: Our plans start at around $299 CAD per month, which typically pays for itself
    by recovering just 10-15 hours of manager or budtender time spent on administrative
    calls. Compared to the cost of a compliance misstep or a missed sale during a
    busy period, it's a very manageable investment in smoother operations.
  goal: Anchor price against high-value outcomes (compliance, sales) and compare to
    cost of personnel time.

    monthly_cost: 450

    payback_months: 1
  value_anchors:
  - Costs less than 3 hours of a store manager's time each month.

  - Recovers multiple lost sales per month from missed calls during peak.
market_context:
  market_size: The legal Canadian cannabis retail market is valued at approximately
    $5 billion CAD annually.
  growth_rate: Steady, driven by new store openings, product format innovation (e.g.,
    beverages, edibles), and continued conversion from the illicit market.
  key_trends:
  - Consolidation of smaller retailers by larger chains.
  - Rapid expansion of cannabis 2.0 products (edibles, beverages, topicals).
  - Increased focus on customer experience and loyalty to compete with illicit sources.
  - Strict enforcement of packaging, labeling, and marketing regulations.
  seasonality:

    - Summer months
    - 420 (April)
    - Christmas/New Year period
    low:
    - January
    - Early Spring (post-holiday)
typical_objections:
- objection: We're a small shop; we can't afford another monthly tech fee.
  response: I appreciate that. Think of it as hiring a part-time, expert administrative
    assistant for less than $10 CAD a day. If it saves your budtender just one hour
    each day from phone duties, it's already paying for itself and letting them generate
    more revenue on the sales floor.
- objection: I don't want a robot talking to my customers; it feels impersonal.
  response: That's a valid concern. Our agent is designed to handle the repetitive,
    transactional calls that staff find tedious—hours, directions, order status. This
    actually allows your *human* team to be *more* personal and invested during the
    high-value, in-store consultations where relationship-building happens. It enhances
    the human touch where it matters most.
- objection: Our current system works fine. We just have our staff answer phones.
  response: That's great that your team manages it. The question is, what's the opportunity
    cost? During a rush, every call a budtender answers is a customer in-store not
    being helped. Our data shows retailers using our agent see an increase in in-store
    conversion rates because staff are freed from phone distractions. It's about optimizing
    your existing team's highest-value activities.
