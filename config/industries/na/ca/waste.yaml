industry_faq:
- question: What day is my garbage and recycling pickup, and has it been changed for
    the holiday?
  answer_template: Your regular collection day is [Day]. For the upcoming [Holiday
    Name], collections will be [delayed by one day / as scheduled]. You can also confirm
    your full annual schedule on our website.
- question: My bin wasn't emptied today. What should I do?
  answer_template: I apologize for the missed pickup. I can report this to our dispatch
    team right now. Please leave your bin at the curb, and a truck will typically
    return within 24-48 business hours. May I have your address to log the service
    request?
- question: What items are accepted in the blue recycling bin?
  answer_template: 'In our program, we accept clean paper, cardboard, plastic containers
    #1-5 & #7, metal food cans, and glass bottles & jars. Plastic bags, Styrofoam,
    and electronics are not accepted curbside. I can text you a detailed list.'
- question: How do I get a new bin or repair a damaged one?
  answer_template: I can submit a work order for a bin replacement/repair. There is
    typically a [e.g., $25] fee for replacement bins, which will be added to your
    next invoice. Damaged lids or wheels are often repaired for free. Is it the garbage,
    recycling, or organics bin?
- question: How are my waste collection fees calculated?
  answer_template: Fees are based on the level of service (bin size, frequency) and
    are set by your municipal contract or, for commercial clients, by your specific
    service agreement. I can look up your current rate if you provide your account
    number or address.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a potential commercial customer asks about pricing for dumpster
    rental or ongoing collection services.
  script: Our pricing is tailored to your specific needs—factors like bin size, pickup
    frequency, waste type, and location all affect the rate. For a standard 10-yard
    bin with weekly pickup, you can expect to start in the range of [e.g., $150-$250]
    per month. To get you a precise, no-obligation quote, I just need a few details
    about your project or business.
  goal: Move the conversation from a generic price question to a qualified lead by
    collecting specific information for a custom quote.
- trigger: compliance_concern
  situation: When a business owner expresses worry about proper waste disposal regulations
    or landfill bans.
  script: You're right to focus on compliance. Mis-handling waste can lead to significant
    fines. Our service guarantees proper documentation and disposal at certified facilities
    for all materials, especially regulated ones like construction debris or organics.
    We handle the compliance paperwork, so you don't have to. Would a free waste audit
    help clarify your specific requirements?
  goal: Position the service as a risk-mitigation and compliance solution, not just
    a cost, and offer a high-value next step (waste audit).
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a customer mentions they are currently using or considering a competitor
    like Waste Connections.
  script: They are a great company. Many of our clients switched to us for more personalized
    service and flexible scheduling. We're locally managed, so decisions are made
    here, not at a distant head office. This often means faster response times and
    contracts that adapt to your actual needs, not a one-size-fits-all model. Can
    I show you a side-by-side comparison?
  goal: Acknowledge the competitor, pivot to a key differentiator (local flexibility),
    and propose a direct comparison.

typical_objections:
- objection: We're under contract with another provider for another year.
  response: I understand. Contracts are important. My goal is to be your preferred
    partner when you're next able to evaluate. Could we schedule a brief waste audit
    now? It's free and will give you concrete data to compare when your renewal comes
    up, ensuring you get the best value next time.
- objection: Your service is more expensive than our current option.
  response: 'It''s important to look at total value. Our price includes [mention key
    differentiators: e.g., superior customer service portal, guaranteed compliance
    documentation, more frequent pickup options]. A small premium often saves significant
    time, avoids fines, and improves your sustainability reporting. Can we do a detailed
    line-item comparison?'
- objection: We're a small business; we just put our garbage in the municipal bin.
  response: That's a common start. However, commercial waste in a municipal system
    is often against bylaws and can lead to fines. A small, locked bin from us protects
    you from those risks and from dumping by others. For as little as [mention entry_point
    price] a month, you get reliable, compliant service.
