industry_faq:
- question: What is your turnaround time for 500 full-colour brochures?
  answer_template: For 500 full-colour digital brochures, our standard turnaround
    is 3-5 business days. Rush options are available. May I get your exact specifications
    to provide a precise quote and timeline?
- question: Do you handle the design or do I need to supply print-ready files?
  answer_template: We focus on expert printing. We require print-ready PDF files.
    We offer a pre-flight check service to ensure your files meet all specifications.
    We can also refer you to trusted local design partners.

    for the intended print job, and securely destroyed upon completion. We can provide
    a data processing agreement.
- question: Can you match a price I got from another printer?
  answer_template: We strive to offer competitive value. Please share the quote details,
    and I will review it with our team. Our focus is on quality, reliability, and
    service, not just the lowest price.
- question: What is the cost difference between digital and offset printing for 1000
    posters?
