industry_faq:
- question: How do you ensure player data handling is compliant with Canadian PIPEDA
    regulations?
  answer_template: Our AI agents are architected with privacy-by-design. They process
    inquiries without permanently storing personal data and can be integrated with
    your compliance stack to handle data access requests, ensuring full PIPEDA adherence.
- question: What's the average cost per install (CPI) for mobile games in Canada right
    now?
  answer_template: CPIs in Canada are typically higher than global averages, often
    ranging from $2.50 to $4.50 CAD for mid-core games, depending on genre and platform.
    Our tools can help optimize your campaigns to lower these costs.
- question: Do you support localization for both English and French Canada?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Our voice agents can be configured for bilingual support
    (en/fr), which is crucial for reaching players in Quebec and other French-speaking
    communities, reflecting Canada's official bilingualism.
- question: Can you help manage player support during a major game launch or update?
  answer_template: Yes, we specialize in scaling support elastically. Our AI agents
    can handle the surge of common questions about downloads, patches, and server
    status, triaging only complex issues to your human team.
- question: How do you handle in-app purchase (IAP) issues and refund requests?
  answer_template: Our agent integrates with your payment gateway and app store consoles.
    It can verify transactions, explain purchase status, and guide users through the
    official refund process for their platform (Apple/Google), reducing chargeback
    risks.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect (e.g., a studio head or ops manager) asks about pricing
    early in the conversation.
  script: I understand you need clarity on investment. Our solutions typically start
    at a manageable $500 CAD per month for core automation, scaling based on call
    volume and integrations. Many studios see a return by reducing their cost per
    support ticket by 60% or more. Would it be helpful to calculate a potential ROI
    based on your current monthly support ticket volume?
  goal: Frame price around value and ROI, not just cost, and pivot to a discovery
    question.
- trigger: pipeda_concern
  situation: When a prospect expresses concern about data privacy and compliance.
  script: That's a critical consideration. PIPEDA compliance is non-negotiable. Our
    system is designed specifically for this. The AI agent acts as a secure interface—it
    doesn't store personal data. All sensitive data processing is routed through your
    own compliant systems. We can also generate audit trails for all interactions.
    Would you like a brief overview of our security architecture?
  goal: Alleviate compliance fears by demonstrating built-in privacy safeguards and
    offer deeper technical reassurance.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions a competitor like a large BPO or generic call
    center solution.
  script: That's a fair comparison. Many of those solutions aren't built for the unique
    flows of gaming—like handling IAP issues or guild management queries. We specialize
    in gaming. Our agents speak your players' language, integrate directly with your
    game backend, and understand metrics like DAU and ARPPU. This focus means faster
    setup and better resolution rates specifically for your players.
  goal: Differentiate by emphasizing deep industry specialization over generic customer
    service.

    tools.

    operations.

  - Unmatched data and resources for hyper-casual/mid-core
  - Proven monetization expertise
  - Huge marketing budgets

- name: Keywords Studios

    operational costs and provide instant, scalable player interaction, complementing
    rather than replacing human effort.

market_context:
  market_size: $5.5 Billion CAD (annual video game market value)
  growth_rate: ~5% YoY
  key_trends:
  - Strong growth in mobile gaming and esports viewership.
  - Increasing government tax credits and incentives (e.g., in BC, Ontario, Quebec)
    for game development.
  - Rising demand for 'games as a service' models requiring sophisticated live ops.

    low:
    - Late Q1 (post-holiday slump)
    - Early September (back-to-school)
typical_objections:
- objection: Our players prefer talking to a real human. An AI will feel impersonal.
  response: I completely understand that concern. Our approach is to use the AI to
    handle the repetitive, transactional questions (like 'is the server down?' or
    'how do I link my account?'). This actually frees up your human staff to have
    more meaningful, complex, and positive interactions with players who truly need
    that personal touch. It enhances the human experience, rather than replacing it.
- objection: We're a small studio; this seems like a cost for bigger companies.
  response: Actually, small studios often benefit the most. You likely wear many hats.
    Automating tasks like scheduling interviews or filtering basic support lets your
    small team focus on core development and creative work. Our entry point is designed
    to be accessible, and the ROI can be very swift by saving you valuable time.
- objection: Integrating a new system sounds technically complex and disruptive.
  response: We prioritize simple, API-driven integrations with the tools you already
    use, like Discord, Zendesk, or your game backend. Our team handles the heavy lifting
    during setup. The goal is to reduce disruption, not cause it. Can I share a simple
    flowchart of a typical 2-week integration process?
