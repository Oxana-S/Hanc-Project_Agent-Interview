industry_faq:
- question: How quickly do you respond to support tickets?
  answer_template: Our service level agreements guarantee an initial response within 1 hour for critical issues during business hours. For our premium plans, we offer 24/7 monitoring and support.
- question: Is our data stored within Canada to comply with PIPEDA?
  answer_template: Yes, we prioritize Canadian data sovereignty. We can outline which of our cloud and backup solutions utilize Canadian data centers to ensure compliance with PIPEDA and other provincial
    regulations.
- question: Do you offer fixed-fee or per-user pricing?
  answer_template: We primarily offer predictable, per-user monthly pricing for our managed services, which includes proactive support, monitoring, and most remote fixes. This helps you budget effectively
    and avoid surprise bills.
- question: What happens if our server goes down after hours?
  answer_template: Our proactive monitoring will alert us immediately. Depending on your service plan, our team will begin remediation efforts, often before your staff is even aware, and we have defined
    escalation paths for after-hours critical incidents.
- question: Can you help us move from an old server to the cloud?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Cloud migration is a core service. We start with a full assessment of your current environment and provide a phased migration plan to minimize disruption, whether you're moving
    to Microsoft 365, Azure, or another platform.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: Prospect asks "How much does this cost?" early in the conversation.
  script: I understand budget is a key consideration. Our pricing is designed to be predictable and scales with the number of users and the level of support you need. For example, many small businesses
    start with our core managed service plan around $150 per user/month. To provide the most accurate quote, could you tell me approximately how many employees you have and if you have any immediate concerns,
    like cybersecurity or a major upcoming project?
  goal: Qualify the lead further and schedule a detailed consultation instead of giving a vague price.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: Prospect mentions they are also talking to a large national provider or a very low-cost local shop.
  script: That's great you're exploring options. Many of our clients came to us from similar situations. What we often hear is that the large firms can be less responsive, while the lowest-cost option might
    not provide the proactive care needed. Our focus is being your local partner—you'll have a dedicated account manager and a team that knows your business. We pride ourselves on transparency; no hidden
    fees and clear SLAs. Would a 15-minute chat with one of our principals to discuss the differences be helpful?
  goal: Differentiate on personalized service and value, not just price, and secure a meeting.
- trigger: busy_decision_maker
  situation: The contact person is too busy to talk or insists on email only.
  script: I completely understand how busy things get. My role is to save you time. I can send a brief email with an overview of how we help businesses like yours reduce IT headaches and some case studies.
    I can also schedule a very short, no-obligation call for a time that works for you—even just 20 minutes next week. Would Tuesday morning or Wednesday afternoon work better for a quick intro?
  goal: Respect their time, provide value via email, but persistently and politely secure a short meeting.

typical_objections:
- objection: We already have an internal IT person.
  response: That's great. Many of our clients have a dedicated IT person. We act as their force multiplier—handling routine monitoring, after-hours calls, and bringing specialized expertise in security
    or cloud projects. This lets your valuable internal resource focus on strategic business initiatives rather than daily firefighting.
- objection: We can't afford a monthly contract right now.
  response: I understand budget constraints. Consider that unplanned IT failures often cost far more than a predictable monthly plan. We could start with a focused project, like a security assessment or
    cloud migration, to demonstrate value. Alternatively, our basic monitoring package starts at a lower point to build the relationship.
- objection: Switching providers seems like a lot of work and risk.
  response: That's a very valid concern. We have a proven, structured onboarding process designed to minimize disruption. We take full responsibility for learning your environment and ensuring a smooth
    transition. We can share case studies of successful migrations and even offer a pilot period for certain services.
