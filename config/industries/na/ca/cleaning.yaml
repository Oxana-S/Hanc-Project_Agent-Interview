industry_faq:
- question: What is your pricing structure?
  answer_template: Our pricing is based on the size of your space, the type of cleaning required, and the frequency. We provide free, no-obligation quotes. For a standard 3-bedroom home, regular cleans
    typically start around $150-$200 CAD. Would you like to schedule a quick assessment?
- question: Are your cleaners insured and bonded?
  answer_template: Yes, absolutely. All our cleaners are fully insured, bonded, and background-checked for your peace of mind. We comply with all relevant regulations, including PIPEDA for your privacy
    and data security.
- question: Do I need to provide cleaning supplies and equipment?
  answer_template: We bring all our own professional-grade cleaning supplies and equipment. If you have a preference for specific eco-friendly products, we can accommodate that—just let us know during booking.
- question: What is your cancellation policy?
  answer_template: We require a 24-hour notice for cancellations to avoid a fee. This allows us to offer the time slot to another client and fairly schedule our cleaning teams.
- question: How do I handle access if I won't be home?
  answer_template: Many of our clients provide a key, use a lockbox, or grant access through a smart lock or garage code. We take security very seriously and have strict protocols for handling client access
    information.
- question: Do you offer green cleaning services?
  answer_template: Yes, we offer eco-friendly cleaning options using products that are effective, safer for families and pets, and better for the environment. There may be a small premium for this service.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about price early in the conversation.
  script: I understand wanting to know the investment. To give you an accurate quote, I need a few details. Is this for a home or business? Approximately what's the square footage or number of rooms? Giving
    you a random number wouldn't be fair. Based on typical homes in your area, budgets often range from $150 to $400 CAD per clean. Would a quick 5-minute call with one of our experts to get a firm price
    work for you?
  goal: Qualify the lead and book a consultation instead of giving a vague price that could scare them off.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions they are also considering a large franchise like Molly Maid.
  script: That's a well-known option. Many clients choose us because we offer more personalized service and direct communication with our local management team, rather than a call center. Our pricing is
    often more competitive for the same level of service, and we're able to be more flexible with custom cleaning plans. Would you like to hear about a couple of recent clients who switched to us for those
    reasons?
  goal: Differentiate on personalization, value, and local ownership without bad-mouthing the competitor.
- trigger: objection_busy
  situation: When a prospect says they are too busy to schedule or have a consultation.
  script: That's exactly why we're here—to save you time. The entire booking process can be done right now in under 5 minutes. I can schedule your first clean for a time that's convenient for you, and our
    team will handle everything from there. You won't need to be home. What does your calendar look like next Tuesday or Wednesday?
  goal: Overcome procrastination by emphasizing convenience and taking immediate action to book.
- trigger: service_doubt
  situation: When a prospect expresses concern about quality or trust.
  script: Your concern is completely understandable. We build trust through transparency. All our cleaners are employees, not subcontractors, and they undergo rigorous training. We're fully insured, and
    every clean is backed by our 100% satisfaction guarantee—if you're not happy, we'll come back and fix it. Can I share a few reviews from your neighborhood?
  goal: Build trust by addressing security concerns head-on and offering social proof.

typical_objections:
- objection: I can clean myself or have an employee do it for free.
  response: That's true, but have you calculated the cost of your time or your employee's time? If your time is worth $50/hour and cleaning takes 3 hours a week, that's $600/month in lost productivity.
    Our service costs a fraction of that and guarantees a professional result.
- objection: I had a bad experience with a cleaner before.
  response: I'm sorry to hear that. We hear that often, which is why we have such rigorous hiring and training, and our satisfaction guarantee. We're confident we can provide a consistently great experience.
    Would you be willing to give professional cleaning one more try with our guarantee backing you up?
- objection: It's not in the budget right now.
  response: I understand budgeting. Many clients start with a one-time deep clean or a bi-weekly service to make it more manageable. The initial investment often reveals how much time and stress it saves,
    making it easier to justify ongoing. Could we start with a single service to show you the value?
