industry_faq:
- question: What are your costs, and does OHIP or my provincial plan cover any of it?
  answer_template: Our services are tailored to individual needs, so costs vary. Provincial plans like OHIP typically cover some clinical services provided by regulated professionals, but not personal support
    or companionship. We can provide a detailed cost breakdown after a free assessment and help you understand potential funding options like veterans' benefits or long-term care insurance.
- question: How quickly can services start? Is there a waiting list?
  answer_template: We strive to begin services as soon as possible, often within 48-72 hours for urgent cases. Wait times depend on the specific care required and staff availability in your area. Our AI
    coordinator can check real-time availability for you right now.
- question: How do you ensure the safety and privacy of my loved one?
  answer_template: All our staff are thoroughly screened, bonded, and insured. We strictly adhere to PIPEDA privacy laws. Our AI system also uses secure, encrypted communication and only shares information
    with pre-authorized contacts.
- question: Can we change the care schedule if our needs change?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Care plans are flexible. You or your family can request schedule changes through your dedicated care manager or directly via our 24/7 voice assistant, which will instantly
    notify our scheduling team.
- question: What happens if the scheduled PSW is sick or unavailable?
  answer_template: We have a pool of qualified backup staff. Our AI system automatically manages call-outs and finds replacements, and will proactively notify you if there is any change to your scheduled
    caregiver.
- question: Do you provide services for seniors with dementia or Alzheimer's?
  answer_template: Yes, we have specialized training in dementia care. Our caregivers and our AI tools are equipped with protocols to support clients with cognitive challenges, including tailored communication
    and safety monitoring.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a caller (often a family member) asks about cost upfront.
  script: That's a very important question. Costs are based on the level and hours of care needed, typically ranging from $30 to $50+ CAD per hour for personal care. The best way to get an accurate quote
    is through a free, no-obligation care assessment. May I ask, are you looking for daily assistance, overnight care, or respite for yourself?
  goal: Move the conversation from price to needs assessment and book a professional consultation.
- trigger: compliance_hesitation
  situation: When a prospect expresses concern about data privacy or using an AI system.
  script: I completely understand your concern for privacy. Our AI system is designed from the ground up to be fully compliant with Canada's PIPEDA laws. It acts as a secure gateway—handling routine tasks
    while ensuring sensitive health data is only accessed by authorized human staff when absolutely necessary. It actually reduces privacy risk by automating compliant log-keeping.
  goal: Reassure the prospect on compliance and reframe the AI as a privacy-enhancing tool.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions a competitor like Bayshore or ParaMed.
  script: Many families consider them, they are reputable providers. Where we differ is in our use of intelligent technology to give you more transparency and immediate response. While they may rely on
    call centres during off-hours, our AI assistant provides your family with instant updates and lets you manage simple requests 24/7, reducing wait times and anxiety.
  goal: Differentiate on technology-enabled service and real-time communication, not just on care.
- trigger: tech_reluctance
  situation: When the prospect (often an older adult or less tech-savvy family member) worries the system will be too complicated.
  script: The beauty of a voice agent is that there's nothing to learn. It works just like a phone call. You or your loved one simply speaks naturally. It's designed for simplicity and accessibility. We
    handle all the setup and provide full support. Would it be helpful if I demonstrated how a typical check-in call works?
  goal: Overcome fear of complexity by emphasizing voice naturalness and offering a demo.

typical_objections:
- objection: It's too expensive for our budget.
  response: I understand. Investing in care is significant. Consider that our system helps optimize staff time, which can reduce overtime costs and improve client retention, indirectly lowering costs. Could
    we explore a pilot program for your most time-consuming task, like family updates, to demonstrate the value?
- objection: Our clients or staff aren't comfortable with technology.
  response: That's a common concern. We've designed it specifically for low-tech users—it's just a phone call. We provide full training and support. Often, after seeing how it reduces their repetitive tasks,
    staff become its biggest advocates. Would a hands-free demo help?
- objection: We're managing fine with our current manual process.
  response: That's great to hear you're coping. Many of our partners started from that point. They found that as they grew, manual processes became a bottleneck and a risk. Our solution helps future-proof
    your operations, ensuring you can maintain that high quality of care as demand increases, without burning out your team.
