industry_faq:
- question: What is your pricing for a private office?
  answer_template: Our private office rates start from [Monthly Price] CAD per month and vary based on size, location within the building, and included amenities. I can connect you with a community manager
    for a custom quote and virtual tour. May I ask how many team members you have?
- question: Do you offer month-to-month contracts?
  answer_template: Yes, we offer flexible month-to-month agreements on many of our hot desk and dedicated desk plans. Private offices often have a minimum term, but we can discuss flexible options. This
    flexibility is a key advantage over traditional leases.
- question: Is the space secure and how do you handle my data privacy?
  answer_template: Absolutely. Our spaces have 24/7 secure access. Regarding privacy, we are fully compliant with Canada's PIPEDA legislation. Your personal and business data is collected only with your
    consent, used solely for its intended purpose, and kept secure.
- question: What amenities are included?
  answer_template: All memberships include high-speed fibre internet, access to communal kitchens with coffee/tea, printing facilities, and networking events. Meeting room credits, mail handling, and event
    space access are available as add-ons or in premium plans.
- question: Can I tour the space before committing?
  answer_template: Of course! We highly recommend a tour to experience our community vibe. I can book you for a personal tour with a community manager at your convenience, either in-person or virtual. What
    day this week works best for you?
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about pricing generally.
  script: I'd be happy to discuss pricing. To give you the most accurate information, could you tell me a bit about your needs? Are you looking for a single desk, a private office for a team, or just meeting
    space occasionally? Our flexible plans start from around [Entry Point Price] CAD.
  goal: Qualify the lead's needs to provide relevant pricing and move the conversation towards a specific solution.
- trigger: interest_in_tour
  situation: When a prospect expresses interest in seeing the space.
  script: Excellent choice. A tour is the best way to feel our community energy. Our community managers can show you the workspaces, amenities, and introduce you to members. I have availability for tours
    on [Day 1] and [Day 2]. Which time works better for you, morning or afternoon?
  goal: Book a firm tour appointment to advance the lead in the sales funnel.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When a prospect mentions a specific competitor like WeWork.
  script: That's a fair comparison. While they offer great scale, we differentiate with a more curated, local community feel and often more personalized service and flexible terms. Our focus is on fostering
    real connections and supporting your business growth, not just providing a desk. Would you be interested in hearing how our members benefit from this approach?
  goal: Acknowledge the competitor, pivot to our unique value proposition, and re-engage the prospect.

  typical_budget_range:
  - 250
  - 3000
  entry_point: 299
  roi_examples:
  - scenario: Startup of 3 moving from cafe/remote work to a dedicated desk plan.
    monthly_cost: 900
    monthly_savings: 2200

  - scenario: Small business of 5 moving from a traditional 3-year office lease to a private office.
    monthly_cost: 2500
    monthly_savings: 6200
    payback_months: 1
  value_anchors:
  - Pay only for the space and services you need, when you need them.
  - Eliminate the capital expense and long-term risk of a traditional lease.
  - Turn fixed overhead (rent, internet, admin) into a variable, scalable operating expense.
market_context:
  market_size: Approximately 1.5-2 billion CAD, with strong penetration in major metros.
  growth_rate: ~15% YoY, driven by hybrid work models and entrepreneurship.
  key_trends:
  - Rise of hybrid work models increasing demand for flexible satellite offices.
  - Growth of niche, industry-specific coworking (e.g., tech, creatives).
  - Increased demand for suburban and neighborhood-based spaces vs. only downtown cores.
  - Members seeking 'community-as-a-service' and networking, not just space.
  seasonality:
    high:
    - January (New Year resolutions, business planning)
    - September (Back-to-work, post-summer)
    low:
    - December (Holidays)
    - Late July-August (Summer vacations)
typical_objections:
- objection: It's too expensive compared to working from home.
  response: 'I understand. While there''s no direct home cost, consider the value: dedicated professional space, high-speed internet, networking opportunities, and separation of work/life. Many members
    find the productivity boost and new business connections alone cover the cost. Would a day pass to try it out help you evaluate the ROI?'
- objection: I'm worried about security for my equipment and data.
  response: That's a critical concern. Our spaces feature secure, controlled 24/7 access, often with individual office locks. For data, our WiFi networks are secure, and we are PIPEDA compliant, meaning
    we have strict protocols for handling any member data. We can discuss specific measures during a tour.
- objection: We might outgrow the space too quickly.
  response: That's a great problem to have, and flexibility is our core advantage. With us, you can easily upgrade to a larger private office or add more desks on short notice, often within the same building.
    This allows you to scale seamlessly without breaking a lease or moving locations.
