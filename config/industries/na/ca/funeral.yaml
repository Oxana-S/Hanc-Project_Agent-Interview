industry_faq:
- question: What do I do when someone passes away?
  answer_template: First, please accept our sincere condolences. If the passing occurs
    at home, you should contact the deceased's family doctor or 911. If it occurs
    in a hospital or care facility, the staff will guide you. Once a medical certificate
    has been issued, you can call us anytime at [Your Number]. We will guide you through
    the next steps with care and compassion.
- question: What is the cost of a basic funeral?
  answer_template: Costs can vary based on the services selected. A direct cremation,
    which includes basic services, transportation, and the cremation itself, typically
    starts around $1,500 to $3,000 CAD. A traditional funeral service with burial
    often starts between $5,000 and $8,000 CAD. We offer a detailed price list and
    transparent consultations to help you plan within your means.
- question: Do you handle pre-arranged funerals?
  answer_template: Yes, we absolutely do. Pre-arranging allows you to make your wishes
    known and can relieve emotional and financial burden from your family. We can
    discuss options for pre-planning (detailing your wishes) and pre-funding (setting
    aside funds in a trust) at your convenience.
- question: What is the difference between a funeral and a memorial service?
  answer_template: A funeral service typically involves the presence of the deceased's
    body, often after embalming and viewing. A memorial service is held without the
    body present, sometimes after cremation. Both are meaningful ways to honour a
    life, and we can help you plan either.
- question: How long after death is the funeral held?
  answer_template: This can vary. Typically, with embalming and preparation, services
    are held within 3 to 7 days. For direct cremation or burial, it may be sooner.
    The timeline is flexible to accommodate family travel and other arrangements,
    and we will work with your needs.
- question: Can we personalize the service?
  answer_template: Certainly. Personalization is a beautiful way to honour a unique
    life. This can include music, themes, displays of personal items, unique venue
    requests, or special rituals. Our directors are experienced in creating meaningful,
    personalized tributes.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a caller asks about the cost of a basic service.
  script: I understand you're looking for guidance on costs, and I'm here to help.
    To provide the most accurate information, may I ask if you are considering a service
    with burial or cremation? Our direct cremation services provide a simple, dignified
    option starting around $1,800 CAD, while a traditional funeral service with burial
    typically begins around $6,000 CAD. The best way to get a clear picture is through
    a no-obligation consultation where we can discuss all options. May I schedule
    a time for one of our caring directors to call you?
  goal: Qualify the lead (burial vs. cremation), provide a value anchor, and book
    a consultation.
- trigger: after_hours_inquiry
  situation: When a call is received outside of standard business hours.
  script: Thank you for calling [Funeral Home Name]. Our office is currently closed,
    but I am here to assist you 24/7. Please know you have our deepest sympathy. To
    help our staff prepare to support you best, could you please share your name and
    a callback number? I can also schedule a specific time for a director to call
    you first thing in the morning. Is the individual currently at a private residence,
    a hospital, or a care facility?
  goal: Express compassion, capture critical lead information (contact details, location
    of deceased), and schedule a callback to secure the client.
- trigger: pre_need_interest
  situation: When a caller inquires about planning ahead for themselves or a family
    member.
  script: That is a very thoughtful and responsible step to take. Pre-planning ensures
    your wishes are honoured and provides great peace of mind for your family. Our
    pre-arrangement consultations are completely free and without obligation. We'll
    discuss everything from service preferences to documentation and funding options.
    The process is straightforward and handled with sensitivity. Would Tuesday or
    Thursday this week work better for a brief phone consultation?
  goal: Validate their decision, explain the no-pressure process, and book a pre-need
    sales consultation.
