industry_faq:
- question: Is cryptocurrency legal and regulated in Canada?
  answer_template: Yes, cryptocurrencies are legal in Canada. The industry is regulated
    by several bodies. Crypto exchanges are considered Money Services Businesses (MSBs)
    and must register with FINTRAC, comply with PIPEDA for data protection, and adhere
    to provincial securities laws where applicable. We operate in full compliance
    with all Canadian regulations.
- question: How do I report my crypto taxes to the CRA?
  answer_template: The CRA treats cryptocurrency as a commodity, so transactions may
    trigger capital gains or income tax. We provide annual tax documents summarizing
    your transaction history. For specific filing advice, we recommend consulting
    with a tax professional experienced in digital assets. Our AI assistant can help
    you generate your transaction report.
- question: What security measures do you have to protect my assets?
  answer_template: We employ industry-leading security including cold storage for
    the majority of funds, mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA), and continuous
    monitoring. Remember, we will never call or email you asking for your password
    or 2FA codes. You can manage security settings directly in your account or with
    our AI assistant.
- question: How long do CAD deposits and withdrawals take?
  answer_template: CAD deposits via Interac e-Transfer are typically instant. Bank
    wire transfers may take 1-3 business days. Withdrawals to your Canadian bank account
    usually process within 1 business day. Processing times can vary slightly depending
    on your financial institution.
- question: Can I hold crypto in my TFSA or RRSP?
  answer_template: Currently, you cannot hold direct cryptocurrency in a registered
    TFSA or RRSP. However, there are regulated investment products, like ETFs, that
    provide exposure to crypto within these accounts. We recommend speaking with a
    financial advisor to explore options that suit your retirement and tax-planning
    goals.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: compliance_concern
  situation: When a business prospect expresses worry about regulatory complexity.
  script: I understand completely. Navigating PIPEDA, FINTRAC, and provincial regulations
    is a major challenge. Our AI agent is specifically configured for the Canadian
    landscape. It automates client onboarding checks, maintains audit trails for data
    requests under PIPEDA, and can even schedule your mandatory reporting reminders.
    This turns compliance from a cost center into a streamlined process. Can I explain
    how it would integrate with your current KYC flow?
  goal: Reframe compliance from a fear point to a solvable efficiency gain.
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When asked about the cost of implementing an AI voice agent solution.
  script: Our pricing starts at a monthly subscription of $299 CAD, which typically
    replaces a significant portion of tier-1 support and administrative tasks. For
    a mid-sized exchange, we often see a reduction of 300+ manual support hours per
    month. This translates to a payback period of under 3 months, followed by ongoing
    savings and improved customer satisfaction scores. Would you like to see a tailored
    ROI estimate based on your current support volume?
  goal: Provide clear pricing, immediately justify it with ROI, and offer a next step.
- trigger: security_objection
  situation: When a prospect is concerned about AI handling sensitive financial information.
  script: Security is our foremost priority, especially in crypto. Our AI agent never
    stores sensitive data like private keys. It operates with strict access controls,
    only retrieving non-sensitive account info after rigorous voice authentication.
    It actually enhances security by consistently enforcing verification protocols
    and reducing human error on routine calls. It's a layer of protection, not a risk.
    We can provide a detailed security white paper for your team.
  goal: Alleviate security fears by explaining built-in safeguards and positioning
    AI as a security asset.

    voice layer that integrates with your existing chat tools.
