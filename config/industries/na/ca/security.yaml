industry_faq:
- question: Are your monitoring services compliant with Canadian privacy laws?
  answer_template: Yes, our monitoring center is ULCS certified and all our procedures are fully compliant with PIPEDA and provincial privacy regulations. We'll provide a compliance overview during your
    consultation.
- question: What's your average response time for alarms in my area?
  answer_template: Our average armed response time is [X] minutes in your region. We can provide specific performance data for your postal code during our security assessment.
- question: Do you offer monitoring for DIY security systems?
  answer_template: We specialize in professional installations, but we do offer monitoring services for certain certified DIY systems. Let me connect you with our technical team to review your specific
    equipment.
- question: How do you handle false alarms?
  answer_template: We use two-call verification to reduce false dispatches whenever possible. Our voice agent will first attempt to contact the premises before dispatching authorities, which can save you
    from municipal fines.
- question: What happens during a power or internet outage?
  answer_template: All our systems include battery backup and cellular communication as standard. We guarantee 24/7 monitoring even during outages, with automated alerts if backup systems engage.
sales_scripts:
- trigger: price_question
  situation: When a prospect asks about pricing for basic monitoring
  script: I understand budget is important. For basic 24/7 monitoring with our two-call verification, we start at $34.95 CAD monthly. This includes cellular backup and reduces false alarm fines by up to
    80%. Would you like me to schedule a 15-minute security assessment to get you an exact quote?
  goal: Provide entry price while emphasizing value and transition to consultation.
- trigger: competitor_mention
  situation: When prospect mentions a specific competitor like ADT or Reliance
  script: That's a good comparison. Many clients choose us because we're locally owned and offer more flexible contracts than the national providers. Our Canadian-based monitoring means faster local response
    times. Could I show you some response time comparisons for your area?
  goal: Differentiate on local ownership and performance metrics rather than price.
- trigger: objection_too_small
  situation: When a small business owner says they're too small for professional security
  script: Actually, 60% of break-ins target small businesses. Our basic commercial package starts at just $89 monthly and can reduce your insurance premiums by 15-20%. That's often a net savings. Would
    you like to hear about our most popular package for businesses like yours?
  goal: Reframe security as cost-saving investment rather than expense.

typical_objections:
- objection: We've never had a break-in, so we don't need professional monitoring.
  response: That's actually the best time to install a system - before anything happens. Most businesses without systems that experience a break-in don't recover. Plus, many insurers offer premium discounts
    that can cover most of the monitoring cost.
- objection: Your startup costs are too high compared to DIY systems.
  response: Professional installation ensures proper placement and reduces false alarms. More importantly, our monitoring includes cellular backup that DIY systems lack. When you factor in potential false
    alarm fines and insurance savings, our system pays for itself within 12-18 months.
- objection: We're locked into a contract with our current provider.
  response: Many clients don't realize their contracts have buyout clauses or expiration dates. We offer a free contract review and can often cover buyout fees for annual contracts. Would you like me to
    schedule a quick consultation to review your options?
